# Project Euler 50 in K

Some answers to [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/).

Solutions *and explanations* to the first 50 Project Euler problems in K (Kona [a K3/K4 dialect], K7, and the K4 and K6 dialects whenever I can.)


#### K7 

K7 is made available by [Shakti](https://shakti.com/), with a good tutorial found [here](https://shakti.com/tutorial/). 

To install you need to have Anaconda / Miniconda, doing something like this:

```
conda create -n shakti python=3.7
source activate shakti
conda install -c shaktidb shakti
conda install -c shaktidb shakti-python
conda install jupyter
python -m ipykernel install --user --name shakti --display-name "shakti"
```

(The jupyter steps aren't really necessary.) Then, you can find the `./k` file at:

```
$ miniconda3/envs/shakti/bin/k
2019-05-24 16:37:43 12core 1gb avx2 Â© shakti m2.0 test
```

So now you'll have access to K7 in your terminal if you do something like:

```
alias k7='rlwrap -r /Users/sdean/miniconda3/envs/shakti/bin/k'
```

Where `rlwrap -r` is needed to use the up and down arrows in K7. Installed by doing `brew install rlwrap` on macOS. [rlwrap man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rlwrap).



#### Kona

Kona can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona). Kona is an open source implementation of K, specifically tries to emulate K3, but includes some aspects of K4.

    git clone https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona.git
    cd kona
    make

    rlwrap -r /Users/snd/kona/k
    kona      \ for help. \\ to exit.

#### K6

K6 can be downloaded by asking the language's author nicely for the binary.

    chmod +x k
    rlwrap -r noah /Users/snd/k

#### K4

K4 comes with the download obtainable from the [Kx website](https://kx.com/download/).

Some of the code comes from Kona's Project Euler [page](https://github.com/kevinlawler/kona/wiki/Project-Euler-Code-Golf), ngn's gitlab [page](https://github.com/ngn/k), and Hakank's K/Kona [page](http://www.hakank.org/k/). As far as I can tell, the K4 and Q solutions are more or less absent from the internet. I've attempted to expand and improve on all of the solutions and explain how they work in terms of Kona, K6, and K4. ngn's work is probably closest to working with Whitney's K6 binary, but most of it doesn't.

# Problem 1

> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

> Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.








## Kona

First, find the modulus for the list of numbers < 10

```
  !10
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

This is possibly immediately confusing since this uses both the monadic and dyadic `!`, enumerating numbers under 10, then finding the `mod` of those numbers (e.g., where `5!3` yields `2`). 

```{}
  (!10)!3
0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0
```



Next, take the numbers that multiples, (`mod` = 0):

```{}
  ~(!10)!/3
1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
```

Finally take those ones, map (`&`) them to the location in `!10`, and sum (`+/`):

```{}
  &~(!10)!/3
0 3 6 9

  +/&~(!10)!/3
18
```

All that's left is the requirement to include 5 and then expand from `!10` to `!1000`. For this we have to go back a few steps to add each (`:`).

```{}
  (!10)!/:3 5
(0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0
 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4)
```

Then make the output binary

```
  ~(!10)!/:3 5
(1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1
 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0)
 ```

Combine, and then where `&` and then, again sum `+/`

 ```

  ~&/(!10)!/:3 5
1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1

  &~&/(!10)!/:3 5
0 3 5 6 9

  +/&~&/(!10)!/:3 5
23
```

Now with `!1000`

```{}
  +/&~&/(!1000)!/:3 5
233168
```

Or with `1e3`

```
  +/&~&/(!1e3)!/:3 5
233168
```







## K4

First, just like in Kona, we can obtain the `mod` of `!10` and `3`. But in order for this to not yield any errors, it appears we have to pass this through a function (`mod:{x-y*x div y}`). If you don't, annoyingly, you'll see this error:

```{}
  (!10) !/ 3
'length
  [0]  (!10) !/ 3
              ^
```

With the `mod` function:

```{}
mod:{x-y*x div y}
  (!10) mod/ 3
0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0
```

Next, use each-right (`/:`) to include both 3 and 5. Then, add in where over (`&/`) the resulting vectors, and `~` to make the `=0`s 1s. Finally, where (`&`) the 1s are, obtain their values, and sum (`+/`) them:

```{}
  (!10) mod/: 3 5
(0 1 2 0 1 2 0 1 2 0;0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4)

  &/((!10) mod/: 3 5)
0 1 2 0 1 0 0 1 2 0

  ~&/((!10) mod/: 3 5)
1001011001b

  +/&~&/((!10) mod/: 3 5)
23
```

```{}
  +/&~&/((!1000) mod/: 3 5)
233168
```





## K6
```
+/&|/~5 3!\:!1000
```
